# House-Price-Prediction
This repository includes resources for a successful working model for House Price Prediction using linear regression based CatBoost Regressor and Catboost model that gives the best accuracy amongst the other alternatives and also it gives the least deflection between actual value and predicted value ,i.e., the price of the houses. 
A flask web app is used in this to provide an interface to the house_price_prediction.py file so that it can provide interactivess to the user which finds it more suitable to enter the values and obtain the target predicted value.
Install the necessary requirements that are listed in the requirements.txt file. For this run the following command
            pip install -r requirements.txt
After installing the requirements successfully, run the flask app through the following command
            python3 app.py
This flask web app will run on the localhost server "localhost:5000" , where 5000 is the port number.
